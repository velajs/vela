Compose native Worker applications through modules. QueueModule now initializes transport configuration at bootstrap and publishes driver-owned native routes, removing application-written consumer bridges. Duplicate queue ownership fails at startup. Cloudflare rejects deliveries without a consumer instead of silently accepting them; existing native decorators and envelopes remain supported.

Cloudflare roots accept dynamic modules and asynchronous factories. RPC server modules and injectable named clients reuse the existing schema-validated dispatcher. Deployment checks validate module queue mappings, producer declarations and RPC service bindings. A four-worker example and exact-archive runtime proof cover composition, native delivery and scheduling.
