# @velajs/authz-cedar

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- a2d2692: Require the Vela 2 module/runtime peer line. Packages that raise their framework or adapter peer requirement ship a major version so existing 1.x installations are not offered an incompatible patch release. Upgrade the related framework integrations together; native queue/bootstrap migration is documented in docs/module-workers.md.

Add transactional memory and Durable Object SQLite adapters, with D1/Workers and PostgreSQL conformance coverage.
