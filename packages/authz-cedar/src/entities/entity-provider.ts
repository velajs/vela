// The entity-resolution SPI.
//
// core.md §0 measured the cost this interface exists to control: adding 500
// irrelevant entities to a request took `statefulIsAuthorized` from 0.136 ms to
// 2.79 ms — a 20x regression. An `EntityProvider` therefore does **not** hand the
// engine "the entity graph"; it hands over the principal plus its transitive
// parents, the single resource plus the parents its policies traverse, and
// nothing else.
//
// The split into three methods is what makes that affordable: `resolvePrincipal`
// is the expensive one (roles, groups, organisation) and is the only part the
// engine memoises — across a `checkMany` batch always, and across requests when
// `entityCache` is enabled.
