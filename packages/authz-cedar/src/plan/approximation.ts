// Direction analysis — the one function in this package where a sign error is a
// CVE (core.md §5.5).
//
// The assembled condition is always `OR(permits) AND NOT(OR(forbids))`, and an
// untranslatable subterm is always replaced by `true`. Follow that substitution
// through the four cases:
//
//   permit, polarity +1   true widens OR(permits)          -> superset  -> PERMISSIVE (unsafe)
//   permit, polarity -1   !true = false narrows the permit -> subset    -> restrictive (safe)
//   forbid, polarity +1   true widens OR(forbids), NOT()   -> subset    -> restrictive (safe)
//   forbid, polarity -1   !true = false drops the forbid   -> superset  -> PERMISSIVE (unsafe)
//
// which is exactly "permissive iff the effect is `permit` and the polarity is
// positive, or the effect is `forbid` and the polarity is negative" — one XOR,
// written once, tested exhaustively.
//
// Replacing an untranslatable forbid subterm by `false` instead of `true` is the
// classic vulnerability this file exists to make impossible: `false` in a forbid
// at positive polarity deletes the forbid, and the plan hands back rows the
// engine would have denied.
