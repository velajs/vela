// Everything in this file is a *type*. It has no runtime imports at all, which
// is what lets the `@velajs/authz-cedar/plan` subpath be loaded by an ORM
// driver without dragging in the engine or the 4.1 MiB Cedar WASM.
//
// Two shapes here are load-bearing for security and are worth stating plainly:
//
//   * `like` carries **tokens**, never a rendered string. Cedar hands us
//     `[{Literal:"a"},"Wildcard",{Literal:"%"}]`; re-serialising that to a
//     pattern is how a literal `%` in a policy turns into a wildcard in SQL.
//     Drivers render tokens themselves with `likeTokensToPattern`.
//   * `cmp.value` is a typed `PlanValue`, never `unknown`. A driver must bind it
//     as a parameter; there is no shape here that invites interpolation.
