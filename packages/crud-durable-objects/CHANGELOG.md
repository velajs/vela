# @velajs/crud-durable-objects

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- a2d2692: Require the Vela 2 module/runtime peer line. Packages that raise their framework or adapter peer requirement ship a major version so existing 1.x installations are not offered an incompatible patch release. Upgrade the related framework integrations together; native queue/bootstrap migration is documented in docs/module-workers.md.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [a2d2692]
  - @velajs/crud@2.0.0
  - @velajs/crud-drizzle@2.0.0

## 1.24.1

### Patch Changes

- a66a3cb: Add typed named database registrations, explicit module/resource routing, database-qualified resource identities and isolated default stores. Preserve single-database authoring and native handle inference.

  Add explicit same-owner resource transaction composition with tenant/lifetime checks, rollback after caught operation errors, draining of accepted work, and ordered outer-commit notifications. Validate native Drizzle scopes and preserve genuine Durable Object transactions. D1 callbacks, cross-database atomicity and composition with non-transaction-aware versioning stores fail explicitly.
