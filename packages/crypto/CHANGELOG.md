# @velajs/crypto

## 1.28.0

### Minor Changes

- Continue the module-based Workers APIs on the 1.x release line. Vela permits breaking changes in minor releases and does not retain compatibility layers. Upgrade the framework and integrations together for native queue dispatch, cron scheduling, RPC modules and asynchronous roots; see docs/module-workers.md.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @velajs/tenant@1.28.0
  - @velajs/vela@1.28.0

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- Publish module-based Workers on the unused 3.x stable release line. Earlier experimental 2.0.0 registry versions are immutable and do not contain this release. Upgrade the framework and integrations together; see docs/module-workers.md for queue bootstrap, native delivery, RPC modules and async root migration details.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @velajs/tenant@3.0.0
  - @velajs/vela@3.0.0

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- a2d2692: Require the Vela 2 module/runtime peer line. Packages that raise their framework or adapter peer requirement ship a major version so existing 1.x installations are not offered an incompatible patch release. Upgrade the related framework integrations together; native queue/bootstrap migration is documented in docs/module-workers.md.
